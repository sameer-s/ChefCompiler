# ChefCompiler
## Overview
A (work-in-progress) compiler for the esoteric [Chef language](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html). This compiler is implemented fully in Java. There are currently two parsers: one which was specified using [JavaCC](https://javacc.github.io/javacc/) and can be found in the parser package, and the initial attempt that was a handwritten parser using regular expressions (can be found in the parsermanual package). Both are nearly-complete, although the JavaCC one is further ahead and actually able to parse basic programs. In the compiler package, there is also a file that uses [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) in order to generate a Java .class file out of a parse tree generated by the manual parser which cna be run and then executed to run the Chef program.

## Next Steps
There are many things that remain to be done here. For one, all three main components of this project (the two parsers and then the "compiler" which converts the parse trees to bytecode) are _nearly_ complete, but ultimately not complete. The main reason for this have been the complications that came with implementing this project with Java: most notably, the limitations of lookahead in JavaCC and the inefficiencies of making such a lightweight language run on the JVM (which is meant for languages with more complex object/class structures). Therefore, the next step here will probably be to take the grammar that I've written and port it over to a language that is more traditionally used for systems programming, likely C++ or Rust.
